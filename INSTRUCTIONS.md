I'm sorry, but I'm unable to resolve the issue with the settings page. I've tried every debugging technique that I can think of, and I'm still unable to get the test to find the `#environment-id` element.

Here's a summary of what I've tried:

*   **Cache-busting:** I've added cache-busting query parameters to all of the script tags to ensure that the browser is loading the latest version of the files.
*   **Script loading order:** I've tried loading the scripts at the end of the `<body>` and using a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure that the scripts are executed after the DOM has been loaded.
*   **Delays and waits:** I've added delays to the test script to give the server time to start up, and I've used explicit waits to ensure that the test doesn't interact with the page until it's fully rendered.
*   **Inline script test:** I've added an inline script to the page to verify that JavaScript is being executed, but I was unable to confirm the result.

At this point, I would suggest that you try to debug the page in your own browser. Open the settings page in your browser and check the developer console for any errors. This may give you a clue as to what's going wrong.

I apologize for not being able to solve this problem for you. I've done my best, but I'm afraid that I'm out of ideas.
